# Manual tests

For these manual tests, you'll need to servers, preferably in the same network so you can reach the highest possible transfer rates and smaller latencies.  Any suggestion to improve these tests is welcome.



## Monitoring strategies and tools

### General

Look at DigitalOcean's graph data (Disk, CPU, Bandwidth).

### Memory footprint monitoring

Monitor memory with

```
watch -n 0.5 'pmap <process-pid> | tail -n 1'
```

### Connection monitoring

Monitor transfers per connection with

```
nethogs
```



## Test large file transmission

### Download a large file with fast origin link and fast client link

#### Download with unbounded transfer rates

In client machine:

```
wget -e use_proxy=yes -e http_proxy=<proxy-addr>:8080 http://releases.ubuntu.com/15.10/ubuntu-15.10-desktop-amd64.iso
```

In proxy machine: use memory footprint and connection monitoring.

#### Download with client rate limit

In client machine:

```
wget --limit-rate=20k -e use_proxy=yes -e http_proxy=<proxy-addr>:8080 http://releases.ubuntu.com/15.10/ubuntu-15.10-desktop-amd64.iso
```

#### Tests with multiple files simultaneously

Force multiple connections to be opened, by downloading multiple times. Using `wget` will rename automatically, so many independent simultaneous downloads can be performed.
